## Introduction
We are making an Arcade Arena Collector for an 2 player arcade cabinet game. The players goals is to collect the most collectable items as possible before the timer limit runs out. Player can collect items but also they can use power ups to have a more better odds to their winning abilities which adds more potential to our game. There also will be traps in the game that players must avoid to complete the game. This game puts an happy feeling of playing against another person when doing an two player game because it is light and easy to comprehend once you start and playing the game. It can have a feel of an challenge to know who can collect the most amount of points when playing this 2D arcade game. It uses the same component controls as a normal arcade game by using the joy stick or the buttons to press when something is activate, but our controls will have the same inputs adding to the game just with different use of adding features or other abilites to the game. We want this to be enjoyable for all age groups that want to play a fun little game during their break, when they are having lunch during their time period, and if they are having a diffcult time with things and they need something to relief their stress for the day.

## Gameplay
Arcade Arena Collector is an 2D game that involves 2 players playing the game on an arcade cabinet setup system digital game. The different mechanics that you can use in this game that can have a more gameplay experience to the players is power ups, pick up items or collectables, and traps that can add challenge immersion to the gameplay. It has a very fun way to express itself by looking at the core mechanic of the game and the 2D design of the game features. We mostly wanted to add an easy gameplay to the game making it not as diffcult to complete but also making it fun to the point where you understand the mechanics and the values of getting the most points aganist the other playes. The goal is to get the most points which will consider how good your skills are and how fast you can complete the game before the time limit runs out. We also want to test how making an 8 axis to shoot projectiles can impact the game focus on projectiles and how we can implement that to feel natural for an arcade style machine game.

We want the player to feel immersive when collecting the drops, like the silver coins, gold coins, etc. You can also use the item that you pick up like the bomb that will spawn and you can carry that item and throw to the other player that basically stuns the character from moving.

## Controls
We want to keep controls as simple as possible and use only a short amount of buttons to play with in the game. The controls should be comfortable to use for the players experience, they should have a understand of a feel to know how to use the mechanics probably and effectively. This mostly shows that created a game in a industry company requires making a game simple and fun for the players experience but as you go furthur into the experience of designing a game than you will be making games that are more larger and require alot more time to complete.

##### Movement
We are using the key functions on our devices to move the character. The controls are (WASD) to move the character up, down, left, right in the game. You can automatically collect the items that spawn on the ground that will give you points of progression. One of the items you pick up can be use to stun the other player from moving, you press a button and that item will be throw outwards which could land on the other player depending on your accuracy of throwing.

## Items
For the players, they can explore around the map and find variety of items like bombs, speed potions, etc. They can use one of the items like the bomb by automatically collecting the item and being able to throw it by clicking the button on the key or the mouse and once they hit the character he will be stun that prevents him from moving for a limit amount of time. Alot of the items could be accessible to you depending on what item you use, they will randomly be spawn throughout the map depending on where their character is and some will give a special ability to use in the game. There is things in the game like pick ups where you can collect these items and it will tell you how much score points/gather items that you collected. The items will be like gold coins, silver coins, etc that can benefit you once you collect them and you may get a special reward at the end or you may get the highest amount of points of how much you collected once you finish the game. One of the coins may be worth more than the other coins in terms of points like the gold coin may be 600 points and the silver coin may be 250 points.

The game might get faster depending on the progression of your game and it might change the difficulty of the coins being collecting, they might spawn far away from you or if you miss to many coins your points might get decrease lowering your value and progression in the game.

## Obstacles
In the game there will be obstacles that you would have to avoid like spike traps which will stun your character if you don't carefully avoid them in game. The player should be able to navigate the map by looking at there surrounds and finding ways to use there skills and collect as many items as possible before the other player collects more of them. This will show how well they know there surrounds of the area and if they can use the skills that they learn to complete the game.

##### Spikes Traps
Stuns the player preventing them from moving their character.

## Progession
The game itself is a 2D map level arcade game which shows once you complete the level you can keep going to progress on your score to gain more points or you can stop at your current score and finish the game there. Some maps will be different than others but will show the full aspect of what is expected to be completed in the level (ie: color palette's, different tempo, etc.,) will be presented in the game to show its tone of gameplay. Some areas have a random change to their map level due to immersive gameplay experience for the player.

## Challenge Mode
The full game itself is a challenge to try and gather as many points as possible. You can use items that you can pick up from the ground to your advantage like bombs to stun the other player, potions to help you get a speed boost, etc. This will encourage players to have a competition between each other making it a fun experience for the player to enjoy the game. The game will be roughly around 30-60 seconds or longer depending on how you play the game, but the goal of this game is to collect as many points as possible before the timer runs out. It just mostly involves on your skills and adaptability of playing this game a 2 player experience.

## Achievements and LeaderBoards
The achievements in the game will be approach in a different way, rather than sometimes rewarding in the gameplay.

##### LeaderBoards
There will probably be no leaderboards in the game for the player to see once they finished the game, but if we did add one it will include the total amount of points that you got before the other player and of how quick you beat the game within the time limit.

## Presentation
Once we developed the core mechanic and core concept, we felt that doing an 2D arcade game would be more accessible for how we are creating this game. It gives us things to work with, like setting up tile palette's, adding different colors to the game, using the sprites that we have been given for our game, being able to organize our files and other stuff to keep our game stable, etc.

##### Art
In this game it is our group design to present an game (like an minigame for an arcade cabinet game) to picture what it would be like if this got display in public like an actual arcade game for people to play. The design of the maps makes it look peaceful and something relaxing to enjoy a well known period of time on this game. It forms the idea of something that can be expanding on if making other games or adding more materials to make our game fun and attractive to other students and even teachers that would want to play our game. With the use of using color palette and lighting it will give this game an beautifully clean and intriguing look of the overall game itself.

## Music
I don't know if we are added music in the game but if we were to include some music in the game we want to both thematically fit it from a gameplay perspective. Usually you got to find the right music to fit with the game, so mabye when your start a match it can have a epic rock & roll moment where you are battling the other player and you have to get the most amount of points than the other player and when the timer starts to decrease it starts to get to a low tone of music which means the game is about to finish and collect any last bit of items before the game ends. The music will be optional depending on how we want to approach this game concept because it has to be a 2D game where people understand the mechanics and mostly just making sure the game works for the player.

## Sounds
For the sound design we are probably going to add sound to the objects to create that tension to the players that they need to collect this or they need to grab this to throw at the other player. We want to make the sound clear for the player that is experience this game to know what the objective is and how to beat the player.

## Interface
In this game the interface is going to be clear and consisted, it won't have any menu screen or options that you have to look over but once you start up the game the chart of the left to the right side in the game gives you a clear idea that this is a 2 player game and you can choose to be on the right or left side by playing the game. Your score will be track on your character to know how much points you have right now and how much points the other player has.

## Bringing our Project to the World
It is important to make this Arcade Arena Collector game extraordinary because all the effort we put into this game proves that we care about this presentation and we want this game to succeed in all its glory and how much fun the players will have as well as how much they experience it and getting important feedback from them. A lot of detail went into this game with the amount of materials that we can use to build it, especially when trying to organize files and making sure everything is up to date on GitHub. When moving around the map it can feel like there is life here but it is all being presented in a 2D arcade game world. When we combined our knowledge and ideas together we can come up with different game ideas or stories to set the tone of our game project.

## Concept Art
We don't have any concept art, we mostly just have pictures of our map ideas for our game. I do have some references of things that we were thinking about adding stuff for our game:
