## Introduction
#### Design Goal
We want to test how having only 8 axes to shoot projectiles can impact a game focused on projectiles and how to implement it in a way that feels natural for an arcade style machine.

We are making an Arcade Arena Collector for an 2 player arcade cabinet game. The players goals are to collect the as many items as possible before time runs out. A player can collect items but also they can use power ups to have a more better odds to their winning abilities which adds more potential to our game. There also will be traps in the game that players must avoid to complete the game. This game puts an happy feeling of playing against another person when doing an two player game because it is light and easy to comprehend once you start and playing the game. It can have a feel of an challenge to know who can collect the most amount of points when playing this 2D arcade game. It uses the same component controls as a normal arcade game by using the joy stick or the buttons to press when something is activate, but our controls will have the same inputs adding to the game just with different use of adding features or other abilites to the game. We want this to be enjoyable for all age groups that want to play a fun little game during their break, when they are having lunch during their time period, and if they are having a diffcult time with things and they need something to relief their stress for the day.

## Gameplay
Arcade Arena Collector is a 2D game that involves 2 players playing the game on an arcade cabinet setup system digital game. The different mechanics that you can use in this game that can have a more gameplay experience to the players is power ups, pick up items or collectables, and traps that can add challenge immersion to the gameplay. It has a very fun way to express itself by looking at the core mechanic of the game and the 2D design of the game features. We mostly wanted to add an easy gameplay to the game making it not as diffcult to complete but also making it fun to the point where you understand the mechanics and the values of getting the most points aganist the other playes. The goal is to get the most points which will consider how good your skills are and how fast you can complete the game before the time limit runs out. We also want to test how making an 8 axis to shoot projectiles can impact the game focus on projectiles and how we can implement that to feel natural for an arcade style machine game.

We want the player to feel immersive when collecting the drops, like the silver coins, gold coins, etc. You can also use the item that you pick up like the bomb that will spawn and you can carry that item and throw to the other player that basically stuns the character from moving.

<a name="controls"></a>
## Controls
The controls are simple: 8-way directional stick to move, one button to fire and start the game.

<a name="items"></a>
## Items
For the players, they can explore around the map and find variety of items like bombs, speed potions, etc. They can use one of the items like the bomb by automatically collecting the item and being able to throw it by clicking the button on the key or the mouse and once they hit the character he will be stun that prevents him from moving for a limit amount of time. Alot of the items could be accessible to you depending on what item you use, they will randomly be spawn throughout the map depending on where their character is and some will give a special ability to use in the game. There is things in the game like pick ups where you can collect these items and it will tell you how much score points/gather items that you collected. The items will be like gold coins, silver coins, etc that can benefit you once you collect them and you may get a special reward at the end or you may get the highest amount of points of how much you collected once you finish the game. One of the coins may be worth more than the other coins in terms of points like the gold coin may be 600 points and the silver coin may be 250 points.

The game might get faster depending on the progression of your game and it might change the difficulty of the coins being collecting, they might spawn far away from you or if you miss to many coins your points might get decrease lowering your value and progression in the game.

## Obstacles
There are walls that block player movement, but still allow projectiles to pass through. Items cannot spawn on obstacles.

## Assets
In this game it is our group design to present an game (like an minigame for an arcade cabinet game) to picture what it would be like if this got display in public like an actual arcade game for people to play. The design of the maps makes it look peaceful and something relaxing to enjoy a well known period of time on this game. It forms the idea of something that can be expanding on if making other games or adding more materials to make our game fun and attractive to other students and even teachers that would want to play our game. With the use of using color palette and lighting it will give this game an beautifully clean and intriguing look of the overall game itself.

<a name="interface"></a>
## Interface
In this game the interface is going to be clear and consisted, it won't have any menu screen or options that you have to look over but once you start up the game the chart of the left to the right side in the game gives you a clear idea that this is a 2 player game and you can choose to be on the right or left side by playing the game. Your score will be track on your character to know how much points you have right now and how much points the other player has.

## Bringing our Project to the World
It is important to make this Arcade Arena Collector game extraordinary because all the effort we put into this game proves that we care about this presentation and we want this game to succeed in all its glory and how much fun the players will have as well as how much they experience it and getting important feedback from them. A lot of detail went into this game with the amount of materials that we can use to build it, especially when trying to organize files and making sure everything is up to date on GitHub. When moving around the map it can feel like there is life here but it is all being presented in a 2D arcade game world. When we combined our knowledge and ideas together we can come up with different game ideas or stories to set the tone of our game project.
